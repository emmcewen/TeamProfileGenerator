 ## Team Profile Generator
# 10 Object-Oriented Programming assignment Project Description
The Team Profile Generator is a command line input application that runs in Node.js and requests for information fromthe user about the team memebers and generates an HTML file displaying the information. 

## Use
The user is prompted to enter the information about their team member and hit enter to move to the next prompt until they are finished with inputting information. The list includes Intern, Manager and Engineer. I was only able to get Engineer and Intern to work properly. I also had an issue with the for loop when selecting the No prompt when asked to add another employee. I will work on debugging that when I have more time in the future.
